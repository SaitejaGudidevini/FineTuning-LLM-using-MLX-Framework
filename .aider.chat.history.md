# YouTube Comment Reply Generator

This project implements an AI-powered YouTube comment reply generation system using DialoGPT fine-tuned on YouTube comments and replies data.

## Overview

The system uses Microsoft's DialoGPT model fine-tuned on a dataset of YouTube comments and their corresponding replies. It can automatically generate contextually relevant and appropriate responses to user comments on YouTube videos.

## Features

- Fine-tuned DialoGPT model for YouTube comment reply generation
- Support for Apple Silicon via MPS (Metal Performance Shaders)
- Custom dataset handling for comment-reply pairs
- Configurable generation parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch with MPS support
- Transformers library
- Pandas
- MLX (optional for additional acceleration)

## Dataset

The system uses two datasets:
1. A sample YouTube comments dataset with predefined replies
2. A custom dataset (`comments_data.csv`) containing:
   - Original commenter information
   - Original comments
   - Channel replies

## Usage

### Training

The model is fine-tuned using a custom dataset class that handles the comment-reply pairs. The training process involves:

1. Loading and preprocessing the data
2. Creating a custom dataset and dataloader
3. Fine-tuning the DialoGPT model
4. Saving the fine-tuned model for inference

### Inference

To generate replies for new comments:

```python
def generate_reply(comment):
    inputs = tokenizer(comment + tokenizer.eos_token, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    input_ids = inputs['input_ids'].to(device)
    attention_mask = inputs['attention_mask'].to(device)
    
    reply_ids = model.generate(
        inputs=input_ids, 
        attention_mask=attention_mask, 
        max_length=100, 
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id, 
        temperature=0.7, 
        top_k=50, 
        top_p=0.9, 
        do_sample=True
    )

    reply = tokenizer.decode(reply_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return reply
```

## Model Parameters

- **Temperature**: Controls randomness (0.7 default)
- **Top-k**: Limits vocabulary to top k tokens (50 default)
- **Top-p**: Nucleus sampling parameter (0.9 default)
- **Max length**: Maximum token length for generated replies (100 default)

## Future Improvements

- Implement sentiment analysis to match reply tone with comment sentiment
- Add more diverse training data
- Implement content moderation for inappropriate comments/replies
- Create a web interface for easy testing

#### give me brief description on what is it about?  

Based on the files you've mentioned, it appears your repository contains:

1. `MLX_finetuning.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook likely related to fine-tuning machine learning models using MLX (Apple's machine learning framework)
2. `README.md` - The standard documentation file for your repository
3. `comments_data.csv` - A CSV file containing what appears to be comment data, possibly for training or analysis

Without seeing the actual content of these files, I can only provide this general description. Your project seems to be focused on machine learning, specifically fine-tuning models using MLX, with some data stored in CSV format.

To provide more specific information or to make any changes, I would need you to add the relevant files to the chat. Which files would you like me to examine or modify?

> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(A)ll/(S)kip all/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

Based on the files you've shared, I can see this is a project for fine-tuning a DialoGPT model to generate YouTube comment replies. The notebook uses PyTorch with MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for Apple Silicon acceleration. The project includes:

1. **MLX_finetuning.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that:
   - Sets up PyTorch with MPS for Apple Silicon
   - Loads a DialoGPT model
   - Creates a custom dataset for comment-reply pairs
   - Fine-tunes the model
   - Includes functions for generating replies to new comments

2. **comments_data.csv**: Contains real YouTube comments and channel replies, with columns for:
   - original_commenter
   - original_comment
   - channel_reply

3. **README.md**: Documents the project, explaining its purpose, features, and usage.

The notebook currently uses a sample dataset for training but doesn't appear to be using the `comments_data.csv` file you've provided. Would you like me to modify the notebook to use your actual comments data for training instead of the sample data?
