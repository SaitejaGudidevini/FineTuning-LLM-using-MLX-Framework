gitf[ 5.44 -  8.60]  Hi, welcome to Honest to Wireless, the world's most honest salesman here.
[ 8.80 -  9.44]  How can I help you today?
[ 9.80 -  13.10]  Hi, yeah, so I'd like a cheap new iPhone, please.
[ 13.62 -  13.80]  Cool.
[ 14.08 -  19.98]  So, unfortunately, the iPhone SEs are out of style, but we do have iPhone 14s, I think
[ 19.98 -  20.88]  that would be perfect for you.
[ 21.06 -  22.02]  I'll get you started with that.
[ 22.02 -  30.20]  Actually, actually, I'd like a cheap, small-ish iPhone with a 48 megapixel camera specifically.
[ 31.28 -  34.78]  Okay, well then, I can get you the iPhone 15 to get started.
[ 35.08 -  35.36]  Perfect.
[ 35.74 -  43.86]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay, so I would like a cheap, small-ish iPhone with a 48 megapixel
[ 43.86 -  47.80]  camera and I gotta have Apple Intelligence, so okay.
[ 48.56 -  55.10]  Nobody ever asked for that, but then I'll get you with an iPhone 15 Pro.
[ 55.24 -  56.14]  We got those on refurb.
[ 56.42 -  62.86]  Okay, so I have exactly $600 to spend on a cheap, small-ish iPhone.
[ 63.36 -  64.80]  I need a 48 megapixel camera.
[ 65.14 -  66.50]  I need Apple Intelligence.
[ 66.82 -  68.20]  I need an OLED screen.
[ 68.34 -  72.08]  I heard that was good and it's gotta have face ID and I want that action button.
[ 72.72 -  73.78]  So I've, yeah.
[ 74.96 -  75.48]  Okay.
[ 77.80 -  83.12]  No, yeah, that's still, an iPhone 15 Pro should actually be good for all of your needs.
[ 83.68 -  87.04]  And also, I hate high refresh rate, so it's gotta be 60 Hertz.
[ 87.58 -  88.84]  And MagSafe, I hate that too.
[ 89.04 -  89.44]  Don't want that.
[ 92.00 -  92.52]  What?
[ 93.88 -  94.98]  Who are you?
[ 98.10 -  104.88]  So this is the brand new 2025 iPhone 16e and this is not a budget phone anymore.
[ 105.32 -  108.34]  So the SEs of the past used to be definitively budget.
[ 108.76 -  109.70]  This one is not.
[ 110.04 -  116.00]  This phone starts at $599 and Apple storage upgrade prices are still ridiculous as usual.
[ 116.20 -  121.14]  So the phone that I happen to be holding and testing right now costs $900.
[ 121.70 -  123.32]  So this is not a budget phone.
[ 123.32 -  130.30]  It happens to be the cheapest new iPhone available, but it's not cheap anymore, which
[ 130.30 -  132.92]  makes it much harder to recommend.
[ 133.20 -  137.82]  See the iPhone SE for the past two generations, even though it's been old body, new chip,
[ 138.30 -  143.20]  it's been the easiest iPhone to recommend for most people, to your parents, to kids,
[ 143.44 -  147.62]  to random people getting their first iPhone, to anyone who is randomly upgrading from an
[ 147.62 -  148.10]  old phone.
[ 148.24 -  150.48]  It's just the cheapest new iPhone and it's fine.
[ 150.48 -  155.48]  But those phones were $399 and $429.
[ 156.06 -  161.24]  So at $599, this phone that they've made, we just look at it differently now.
[ 161.66 -  164.34]  And so I've been using this phone for the past week trying to figure out who I think
[ 164.34 -  170.82]  I could actually recommend to buy it and I don't think there is one.
[ 177.24 -  183.50]  The secret to making the SE iPhone so cheap for years has been the parts spin strategy,
[ 183.74 -  188.66]  basically taking parts that they've already spent the money engineering and just Frankensteining
[ 188.66 -  189.02]  them together.
[ 189.44 -  191.68]  And this is true again for the 16E.
[ 191.90 -  194.76]  So this time it's mostly in the body of the iPhone 14.
[ 195.02 -  200.58]  So you've got your aluminum build, your flat sides, your USB type C, even IP68 water
[ 200.58 -  203.82]  resistance, but then it's a new single camera ring on the back.
[ 204.20 -  204.92]  We'll get to that in a minute.
[ 205.34 -  208.02]  And they've added the action button to the left side too.
[ 208.68 -  211.78]  Up at the front, it also still appears to be straight from the iPhone 14.
[ 211.98 -  215.48]  You've got your 6.1 inch screen with a notch and face ID.
[ 215.98 -  220.52]  It definitely is just all bringing the cheapest iPhone up to date with a more modern look.
[ 220.96 -  222.98]  Again, remember the last one looked like this.
[ 223.30 -  224.58]  So this is way better.
[ 224.76 -  226.10]  It's not the brightest display in the world.
[ 226.18 -  230.40]  So once you get it out into direct sunlight, it's a bit less visible than some other
[ 230.40 -  231.44]  actually modern displays.
[ 232.18 -  235.84]  And it's also still 60 Hertz, which is still silly.
[ 236.06 -  238.20]  But in general, it looks fine.
[ 238.30 -  240.74]  But this is exactly where the nickel and diming begins.
[ 241.14 -  246.92]  So you've got this whole family of iPhone 16s now, 16E, 16s and 16 pros.
[ 247.58 -  249.40]  Good, better, best if you want to call it that.
[ 249.58 -  254.76]  And so the cheapest iPhone, they've had to take stuff out of it to get it down to this
[ 254.76 -  255.10]  price.
[ 255.70 -  258.42]  Some of the stuff they've taken out, not that big of a deal.
[ 258.92 -  262.12]  Some of the stuff they've taken out, kind of harder to swallow.
[ 262.34 -  262.88]  So here's one.
[ 263.24 -  267.06]  The headline is that it gets the newest silicon straight from the flagship iPhone 16, the
[ 267.06 -  267.82]  A18 chip.
[ 268.38 -  268.58]  Great.
[ 269.24 -  269.72]  Asterisk.
[ 270.18 -  273.06]  This is not exactly the same silicon.
[ 273.80 -  276.02]  This chip has one less GPU core.
[ 276.64 -  277.62]  Pretty classic binning.
[ 278.28 -  279.16]  Not that big of a deal.
[ 279.32 -  280.06]  This happens all the time.
[ 280.14 -  281.74]  We just saw the Oppo Find N5.
[ 282.20 -  286.66]  That also has a binned Snapdragon 8 Elite with only seven cores instead of the typical
[ 286.66 -  287.18]  8.
[ 288.04 -  289.46]  It's barely a footnote, honestly.
[ 289.58 -  294.58]  You'll only really maybe notice it with intense gaming with the few games that are actually
[ 294.58 -  295.88]  that taxing on the GPU.
[ 296.52 -  298.70]  But aside from that, it's really good.
[ 298.86 -  302.72]  This formula has worked in the past and it's always ended up being on paper one of the
[ 302.72 -  304.78]  most powerful phones in its price bracket.
[ 304.96 -  306.08]  And that's still true.
[ 306.20 -  306.74]  It still is.
[ 307.06 -  308.70]  So a binned CPU, GPU, fine.
[ 309.34 -  310.04]  Fine cut.
[ 310.72 -  311.36]  Another cut.
[ 312.02 -  312.50]  Colors.
[ 313.22 -  314.04]  There's no colors.
[ 314.42 -  316.74]  There's only matte black or matte white.
[ 316.74 -  320.62]  This whole design here really is actually, it's super clean and also super boring.
[ 320.92 -  323.94]  There's a complete lack of text anywhere on the back.
[ 324.20 -  328.04]  And then honestly, the relatively small camera bump is a bit refreshing, honestly.
[ 328.52 -  332.42]  But yeah, if you want any type of color on this phone, you'll need a case or a skin to
[ 332.42 -  332.78]  get that.
[ 333.10 -  338.70]  It's funny, the last two iPhone SEs I reviewed were both bright red, which I thought was fun.
[ 339.12 -  345.44]  And now there's actually no more product red products anywhere in Apple's lineups.
[ 346.00 -  349.90]  That was that program that was the red colored products where the proceeds would go to help
[ 349.90 -  351.12]  support AIDS programs.
[ 351.36 -  353.62]  I kind of wonder what happened to that.
[ 353.86 -  354.82]  So colors, that's another cut.
[ 355.16 -  355.16] 
[ 356.62 -  359.16]  No MagSafe in a 16E.
[ 360.04 -  362.80]  That one feels a little worse.
[ 363.12 -  367.18]  So obviously the last SE also didn't have MagSafe, but that was three years ago.
[ 367.40 -  373.18]  And MagSafe has now become a staple of the iPhone experience, at least I thought.
[ 373.18 -  376.88]  And this is supposed to be the cheapest version of a modern iPhone.
[ 377.38 -  383.28]  But no, this phone has just slow first gen Qi wireless charging that maxes out at seven
[ 383.28 -  384.00]  and a half watts.
[ 384.54 -  387.86]  And since there's no magnets to make sure you get alignment right, if you're just a
[ 387.86 -  390.02]  little bit off, it can be painfully slow.
[ 390.40 -  396.06]  This week I had it on my desk charger for like half an hour and it gained 0% while just
[ 396.06 -  396.60]  getting warmer.
[ 396.88 -  399.44]  I don't have to remind you of the downsides of early wireless charging.
[ 399.44 -  403.86]  Of course, if you really, really want MagSafe on your 16E, there's nothing stopping you
[ 403.86 -  404.76]  from getting a case.
[ 405.22 -  408.10]  So I've got one from Channel Sponsored Dbrand here, their grip case.
[ 408.54 -  411.62]  And it's got the magnets in the case like we've seen in the Android world.
[ 411.80 -  415.00]  So perfect alignment every time.
[ 415.68 -  421.78]  Yeah, I guess Apple didn't want SE users who only spend $600 to be able to get MagSafe
[ 421.78 -  423.94]  accessories on the back of their phone without a case.
[ 424.08 -  427.12]  Oh, and while we're at it, if you want to get full production, Dbrand also supports
[ 427.12 -  430.96]  the 16E with their easy to install Prism 2.0 screen protector.
[ 431.36 -  434.32]  So you can actually save 15% if you bundle a prism with a grip case.
[ 434.48 -  436.40]  So I'd recommend that route if you're buying both.
[ 436.68 -  439.10]  Check them both out at dbrand.com slash bundle.
[ 439.90 -  444.98]  Either way, the iPhone has been the phone with magnets for so long in my head that I
[ 444.98 -  449.80]  just feel like it's super disappointing to not have them in a new $600 iPhone.
[ 451.12 -  452.68]  But now we got to talk about that camera.
[ 452.82 -  454.76]  So there's a new single camera on the back.
[ 455.22 -  459.56]  I actually think the whole good, better, best thing with the iPhones were like the
[ 459.56 -  463.40]  cheap one has one camera, the middle one has two cameras and the best one has three cameras.
[ 463.76 -  467.64]  It actually feels pretty natural and like an easy to understand hierarchy.
[ 467.98 -  472.98]  But please understand that this single camera is also not the same as the primary
[ 472.98 -  474.70]  camera on the iPhone 16.
[ 475.26 -  478.04]  It's 48 megapixels, just like the 16 and 16 Pro.
[ 478.14 -  479.18]  But that's only part of the story.
[ 479.52 -  483.42]  It is actually a much smaller sensor with inferior stabilization.
[ 483.98 -  489.54]  So that manifests itself into just a very different look for photos.
[ 489.86 -  492.88]  It kind of reminds me a lot, actually, of the A series Pixel phones.
[ 493.16 -  495.90]  It's not necessarily a worse look during daytime anyway.
[ 496.32 -  502.06]  It's just different, way less shallow depth of field, a lot less natural bokeh.
[ 502.32 -  506.90]  There's still plenty of sharpness and typical iPhone colors and saturation.
[ 507.28 -  513.16]  But then the image definitely gets much more quickly soft as the light starts to go away.
[ 513.16 -  515.24]  Because the tiny sensors just not getting as much light.
[ 515.50 -  519.48]  It gets less likely to freeze action and more likely to kick in night mode.
[ 519.68 -  525.74]  Also missing the second lens means you're missing cinematic mode, spatial video and macros.
[ 526.32 -  529.96]  So I just think in general, if you're the type of person that cares a lot about
[ 529.96 -  534.74]  the camera on your phone, you can see the clear, steady progression of better iPhone
[ 534.74 -  535.66]  equals better camera.
[ 536.24 -  539.50]  But this one, honestly, for its price range is fine.
[ 539.68 -  543.00]  Now, there's a couple other smaller things that the iPhone 16E also doesn't
[ 543.00 -  546.24]  have Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 support.
[ 546.48 -  546.86]  It's one of them.
[ 547.84 -  549.84]  Honestly, not a huge deal to me.
[ 549.96 -  551.48]  It would be nice for future proofing.
[ 551.64 -  555.38]  Other phones do have it, but a lot of people will never notice because they also
[ 555.38 -  556.54]  will never update their router.
[ 556.68 -  558.10]  There's also no ultra wide band.
[ 558.22 -  562.24]  So you cannot do the precision finding with any air tags or anything like that.
[ 562.26 -  565.48]  There also is the action button, but there is no camera control on this phone.
[ 565.60 -  567.96]  But honestly, I don't think anyone's dying for that.
[ 568.06 -  572.04]  But the sneaky X factor with this phone is they've actually introduced a new part.
[ 572.64 -  577.60]  And that's Apple's first in-house designed cellular modem called C1.
[ 577.76 -  578.92]  So there were some rumors about this.
[ 579.04 -  583.02]  I remember from years back, Apple spent literally a billion dollars acquiring
[ 583.02 -  584.88]  part of Intel's modem business.
[ 585.20 -  586.66]  So fast forward six years.
[ 586.86 -  591.22]  And this is the first iPhone that doesn't have a Qualcomm modem in it.
[ 591.48 -  596.32]  Apple's replaced it with their own for 4G, 5G, GPS and satellite.
[ 596.60 -  599.98]  Now, they've had a lot of success with the vertical integration thing lately.
[ 599.98 -  603.88]  We just saw this with, you know, Apple Silicon, replacing all the Intel chips
[ 603.88 -  605.18]  that used to be in MacBooks.
[ 605.78 -  612.24]  So I think the question people are wondering is, is this the Apple Silicon of modems?
[ 613.14 -  617.22]  And I think the short answer is you probably won't really notice anything,
[ 617.40 -  619.24]  but that's actually a good thing.
[ 619.32 -  623.10]  Like I did speed tests in different places, didn't find anything really too dramatic.
[ 623.60 -  627.34]  Gripping the phone differently in different ways also doesn't seem to matter at all.
[ 627.34 -  630.24]  Because as far as I can tell, the antennas aren't really changed.
[ 630.76 -  633.80]  There is no millimeter wave 5G support with this modem yet.
[ 634.14 -  637.48]  That's something to keep in mind, though, again, a lot of people will also
[ 637.48 -  641.98]  never notice that what is sneaking important, though, is modems can be or have been
[ 641.98 -  644.26]  really big power draws in phones.
[ 644.42 -  646.76]  Like you've probably noticed this, if you're in an area with like kind of
[ 646.76 -  650.10]  crappy cellular signal and your phone is like hunting and switching back and
[ 650.10 -  653.66]  forth between 4G and 5G, that can drain your battery a lot.
[ 653.66 -  657.74]  And the main claimed improvement of the C1 really is actually efficiency,
[ 657.94 -  658.80]  which I love to hear.
[ 658.96 -  663.52]  It's funny, SE iPhones of the past have always also been small because
[ 663.52 -  664.50]  they're using older bodies.
[ 664.80 -  668.42]  So small body, but modern processor that draws a lot of power.
[ 668.60 -  671.50]  So battery life was just not a strong suit of those phones.
[ 671.78 -  675.22]  But this 16E is a modern sized big phone.
[ 675.52 -  679.38]  And then it has this new, more efficient modem that is actually physically smaller
[ 679.38 -  682.00]  and makes room for a physically larger battery.
[ 682.00 -  685.70]  So battery life on this phone has been really good in my wiki using it,
[ 685.88 -  687.58]  literally on par with my 16 Pro.
[ 688.16 -  691.90]  It wireless charges way slower, but it's really good battery.
[ 692.10 -  693.70]  So two main thoughts here on the C1.
[ 694.24 -  698.94]  One, if Apple's been working on this for years, it actually makes sense that
[ 698.94 -  704.26]  they would debut it in a relatively low stakes, lower volume phone like the 16E.
[ 704.74 -  707.52]  You know, iron out any kinks or figure out if there's any issues with it.
[ 707.60 -  711.40]  And then when it's a big deal and the iPhone 17 series later this year,
[ 711.40 -  712.60]  should be all set.
[ 712.76 -  718.90]  But also two, maybe this is like the other missing piece that will help enable
[ 718.90 -  721.96]  Apple to make this like super thin iPhone air.
[ 722.12 -  724.84]  Everyone's talking about Apple's always wanted to make super thin stuff,
[ 725.02 -  727.24]  but battery life always suffers when you do that.
[ 727.64 -  733.10]  So maybe this alongside that silicon carbide battery tech could enable them
[ 733.10 -  736.86]  to make an iPhone that's super thin whose battery doesn't suck.
[ 737.34 -  740.58]  Maybe we'll say, but overall the iPhone 16E.
[ 741.38 -  744.92]  The more I think about this phone, the more it feels like it exists
[ 745.62 -  751.00]  specifically to push you up to an iPhone 16 in Apple's classic price ladder.
[ 751.24 -  754.82]  You get enticed by this base price, but then the next rung on the ladder is only
[ 754.82 -  758.94]  a small jump away and sitting there with all of its shiny extras like MagSafe
[ 758.94 -  760.64]  and an ultra wide camera.
[ 760.88 -  761.54]  Here's a problem though.
[ 762.22 -  764.10]  This phone fits the price ladder.
[ 764.38 -  764.74]  Sure.
[ 765.16 -  766.96]  But it doesn't fit the price tag.
[ 767.68 -  770.32]  Like, let's be real, everything that's wrong with this phone.
[ 770.58 -  771.10]  Is the price.
[ 771.76 -  779.90]  Now I'm sure tariffs, the R&D of this new C1 chip, the extra RAM to support
[ 779.90 -  784.16]  Apple intelligence, inflation, maybe even like all these things to some extent
[ 784.16 -  785.88]  contribute to the higher price of this phone.
[ 786.70 -  791.74]  Maybe Apple also plans on increasing the entire iPhone 17 lineup price too.
[ 791.90 -  795.12]  But this is the same identity crisis that the Pixel A series just had.
[ 795.26 -  798.46]  I don't know if you remember that, but that budget phone came out.
[ 798.46 -  803.54]  But the slightly older, more premium phone was still a better deal for most people
[ 803.54 -  805.54]  because it was on a slight discount already.
[ 805.70 -  811.90]  So you could get a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro for $600 today.
[ 812.50 -  818.20]  I could argue that every single person considering the 16E should start by
[ 818.20 -  819.76]  considering the 15 Pro.
[ 820.20 -  822.98]  It's just everything about it is better.
[ 823.12 -  825.06]  The screen, it's way brighter, more visible.
[ 825.58 -  827.00]  It's a higher refresh rate.
[ 827.00 -  830.44]  Triple cameras instead of one camera, same battery life.
[ 830.82 -  832.02]  It's only one year older.
[ 832.66 -  833.66]  It's got Apple intelligence.
[ 833.92 -  836.34]  It's just, you should just start with that phone instead.
[ 836.60 -  839.44]  And I actually feel like I know what Apple's answer would be if I asked them
[ 839.44 -  840.36]  who should buy this phone.
[ 840.48 -  845.46]  Cause if you go to their site for the 16E, the built in compare tool only shows
[ 845.46 -  852.04]  comparisons versus iPhone 12 and 12 mini and iPhone 11 and the older SCs.
[ 852.14 -  855.40]  So basically if you're somebody with one of these older phones, then this would
[ 855.40 -  857.34]  be a perfectly fine upgrade for you.
[ 857.60 -  862.10]  You get that more modern design, the new chip, Apple intelligence and you're set.
[ 862.36 -  862.90]  And they'd be right.
[ 863.24 -  865.64]  It's not a bad phone for those people at all.
[ 865.94 -  868.56]  It's just the new price does not match the phone.
[ 871.80 -  872.32]  What?
[ 873.66 -  874.76]  Who are you?
